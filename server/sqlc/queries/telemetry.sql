-- site_id is row-stamped from device.site_id (looked up by
-- device_identifier) so per-site telemetry filters use the row-stamped
-- site even after the device is reassigned. Inline sub-select rather
-- than a CTE+SELECT INSERT — ON CONFLICT on the device_metrics
-- hypertable PK requires VALUES-shape INSERT. The sub-select does NOT
-- filter by deleted_at: telemetry from a soft-deleted device is still
-- legitimate per-site history, matching InsertError /
-- InsertMinerStateSnapshot which also stamp from the device row
-- regardless of soft-delete state. Duplicate historical identifiers are
-- resolved deterministically, preferring the live device row.
