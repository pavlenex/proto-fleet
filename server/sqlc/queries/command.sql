-- error string (truncated by the caller) or the reaper reason.

-- custom_name/manufacturer/model/ip_address/mac_address/site_id are
-- captured from device + discovered_device at command-completion time
-- (the first terminal write) and deliberately left untouched by the ON
-- CONFLICT branch, so retries and the reaper never overwrite the
-- first-write values. site_id specifically anchors the row to the
-- device's site at completion time so per-site command history doesn't
-- shift when the device is later reassigned. The read path composes the
-- display name via fleetmanagement.ComposeDeviceName so this query
-- stays free of any rendering rules.
