# Facility Fan Curtailment Integration

## Summary

Give curtailment response profiles the ability to coordinate facility fans
with miner curtailment. When miners are curtailed, the facility fan (or fan
group) is turned off after a configurable delay. On restore, the fan is
turned on first, and miners are restored after a configurable delay.

To support this, infrastructure devices (fans and fan groups behind a PLC)
become a persisted, first-class concept with add/edit UI, and the server
gains a protocol-agnostic driver adapter layer whose first implementation is
a Modbus TCP on/off (0/1) write.

## Target hardware and integration contract

- The site fans are driven by Eaton H-Max HVAC variable frequency drives,
  which support Modbus TCP. Run/stop is controlled through the drive control
  word (address `2001`, commonly referenced as holding register `42001`,
  bit `B0`); a speed reference exists at address `2003` (scaled `0..10000`
  for `0..100%`) for future speed control.
- The operator reports the PLC integration in front of the fans is
  deliberately simple: on/off, i.e. writing `0` or `1`.
- Because the exact write target may vary per site (direct to drive vs.
  through the PLC), the register address and write mode (coil vs. holding
  register) are per-device configuration, not code.

## Hardware review findings and gaps

Findings from reviewing the plan against the Eaton H-Max application manual
(MN04008006E) and the operator's description of the fan integration.

### Verified against the manual

- Register map is correct: FB Control Word at application address `2001`
  (16-bit holding area), FB Speed Reference at `2003` (scaled `0..10000`),
  FB Status Word at `2101` (start of the FBProcessDataOUT range used by the
  v2 read-back). The simpler coil `0001` (RUN/STOP, control word bit 0) is
  also available and fits the configurable `write_mode`.
- Per-device register address + write mode is the right shape: it absorbs
  the direct-to-drive vs. behind-PLC variance and Modbus's off-by-one
  addressing conventions (the manual notes holding register `40001` is
  addressed as register `0000` on the wire), turning both into commissioning
  details instead of code.
- Coil functions (FC1/FC5) are TCP-only on the H-Max per its
  supported-functions table. No impact on v1 (Modbus TCP), but relevant if
  the future Modbus RTU / fleetnode work targets the drive's coil map —
  RTU would have to use holding-register writes.

### Gap 1: drive-side commissioning prerequisites (must document)

The plan assumes the drive obeys fieldbus writes, but that requires
drive-side configuration:

- Remote control place must be set to fieldbus control
  (`START SRC AUTO` → Fieldbus); otherwise the drive ignores the control
  word and follows local keypad/analog inputs.
- The H-Max has a communication time-out parameter that faults the drive
  when the fieldbus master goes quiet. With write-once-at-transition
  sequencing, the drive could fault between our writes. Each site must
  either set the comm timeout to `0` (not used) or the server must poll.

These become a per-site commissioning checklist that gates enabling
automatic fan writes (Phase 5) for that site:

1. Fieldbus control place set (`START SRC AUTO` → Fieldbus).
2. Comm timeout set to `0` (not used). Gap 2's re-assertion acts as a
   fieldbus keepalive only while an event is in a fan phase — between
   events the link is quiet, so a nonzero comm timeout would fault the
   drive during normal operation until v2 status polling lands.
3. Write target verified on the live drive/PLC: confirm the configured
   register/coil and write mode produce clean run/stop transitions,
   including that a whole-register `0`/`1` control-word write is acceptable
   for the site's drive configuration (coil `0001` writes only bit 0 and
   sidesteps the question where available).
4. Server-to-device network reachability confirmed (see the Phase 4
   precondition).

### Gap 2: one-shot writes don't survive device restarts (design change)

Stamping `fan_off_sent_at` / `fan_on_sent_at` gates each write to exactly
once per phase. If a drive or PLC power-cycles mid-phase, it may come back
in its default state: fan back on during curtailment silently degrades the
power savings; a fan that drops off during restore is never re-commanded
on, which is the dangerous direction. Since the reconciler already runs a
30s loop and the writes are idempotent, the reconciler should **re-assert
the desired fan state every cycle while a fan phase is active** — the
timestamp gates only the *first* write (delay handling and miner-restore
gating are unchanged); subsequent cycles keep asserting the same state.
This also serves as the fieldbus keepalive from Gap 1. Phase 5 reflects
this.

### Watch items (not v1 requirements)

- No anti-short-cycle protection: recurtail resets the fan phase fields, so
  rapid curtail/restore sequences could toggle a fan quickly. Curtailment
  cadence makes this unlikely; revisit if operators report rapid cycling
  (mitigation would be a minimum dwell time between fan state changes).

## Decisions

1. **Pluggable driver adapters, Modbus TCP first.** The core stores a
   `driver_type` string and an opaque `driver_config` JSON blob; all
   protocol knowledge lives in adapter packages behind a registry.
2. **Delay-only sequencing for v1.** Restore sends fan ON, waits the
   configured delay, then restores miners. Command send failures are
   retried, then alerted on — they do not block miner restore. This is
   deliberately fail-open in the thermally unsafe direction: a restore-side
   send failure means miners come back without a confirmed fan ON write, so
   it raises an operator-visible alert at the moment miner restore begins
   (not only an activity-log row), and per-cycle re-assertion keeps
   attempting fan ON afterward. Curtail-side failure, by contrast, only
   costs power savings.
3. **Status read-back is explicit future work.** v2 should confirm the fan
   is actually running (e.g. H-Max status word at address `2101`, run bit /
   actual speed) before miners restore, and block restore when airflow
   cannot be verified. The driver interface reserves a `ReadStatus`
   operation for this.

## Current state

| Area | State today |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure device UI | `client/src/protoFleet/features/infrastructure/` has an Add Infrastructure Device modal (`AddInfraDeviceModal`, `ManualAddStep`), a device list (`InfraDeviceList`), and an existing edit surface — an Edit row action / row click opens `InfraDeviceDetailModal` with editable name/site/endpoint/port/enabled fields and save/delete callbacks. The client still holds everything in local React state, but the backend now exists on `main` (PR 1, [#724](https://github.com/block/proto-fleet/pull/724)): migration `000122`, `proto/infrastructure/v1` + generated TS, domain CRUD service, and Connect handlers. Phase 2 wires the client to it. |
| Response profiles | Full stack: `curtailment_response_profile` table, `CurtailmentResponseProfile` in `proto/curtailment/v1/curtailment.proto`, `ResponseProfileService` in `server/internal/domain/curtailment/response_profile.go`, and `CurtailmentStartModal` (`variant="responseProfile"`) on Settings → Curtailment. No fan fields. |
| Curtailment reconciler | 30s polling loop in `server/internal/domain/curtailment/reconciler/` with existing timestamp-gate patterns (batch intervals, max duration). Miner-only; restore currently begins miner batches immediately on entering `restoring`. |
| Fan command path | None. The server MQTT client is subscribe-only; there is no Modbus, PLC, or facility-device code in `server/`. |
| Miner plugin system | HashiCorp go-plugin gRPC subprocesses keyed by `driver_name`, loaded from `PLUGINS_DIR` by `server/internal/domain/plugins/manager.go`. The contract is mining-specific (`StartMining`, hashboards, pools), so infrastructure devices mirror its shape rather than reuse it. |

## Driver adapter architecture

The core (schema, protos, reconciler, CRUD service) knows only three
protocol-blind facts about an infrastructure device: its kind
(`single_fan` | `fan_group`), a `driver_type` string, and an opaque
`driver_config` JSON blob. Everything protocol-specific lives in adapters.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Reconciler["Curtailment reconciler"] --> Iface["infrastructure.Controller interface"]
  CrudSvc["Infra device CRUD service"] --> Registry
  Iface --> Registry["Driver registry: driver_type to adapter factory"]
  Registry --> Modbus["modbustcp adapter (v1): config schema, validation, FC5/FC6 write"]
  Registry --> Future["future adapters: mqtt, http, bacnet, ..."]
```

- `server/internal/domain/infrastructure/driver/` defines the `Controller`
  interface and a registry mapping `driver_type` → adapter factory:
  - `SetState(ctx, device, state DesiredState) error` — struct-based so
    future capabilities are additive: `DesiredState` carries a power mode
    (on/off) in v1 and can gain fields like `SpeedPercent` without breaking
    call sites.
  - `ValidateConfig(json.RawMessage) error` — the CRUD service delegates
    `driver_config` validation to the adapter, so core validation code
    never learns protocol details.
  - `Capabilities() map[string]bool` — v1: `{"on_off": true}`; lets future
    speed-capable drivers be distinguished and the UI capability-gated.
  - A doc comment reserves `ReadStatus` for the v2 read-back requirement.
- Each adapter is its own package (first: `driver/modbustcp/`) owning config
  parsing, validation limits, protocol I/O, timeouts, and retries.
- The `Controller` interface is deliberately shaped like a future protobuf
  `InfrastructureDriver` service so an adapter can later be extracted into a
  go-plugin subprocess (as miner drivers are) for OT-network or
  process-isolation needs — e.g. Modbus RTU executed site-local on
  fleetnode — without changing the reconciler or CRUD service. The
  subprocess machinery is out of scope for v1: it would need a new plugin
  contract, a separate plugin directory (the server loads every executable
  in `PLUGINS_DIR` as a miner driver today), and build-pipeline changes.
- The client mirrors the pattern: driver-specific connection form fields
  live in per-driver-type form modules keyed by the same `driver_type`
  string, so a new protocol adds a form module + a select option, not modal
  changes.

Extensibility summary:

| Future change | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| New protocol (MQTT, HTTP, BACnet, ...) | Adapter package + registry entry + client form module. No schema, proto, reconciler, or CRUD changes. |
| New capability (fan speed) | Additive `DesiredState` field, adapter support, additive profile fields (e.g. `curtail_action`, speed percent). H-Max speed reference register already exists. No breaking changes. |
| New device kinds (dampers, pumps) | Reuse the `infrastructure_device` table/proto via `device_kind`. |
| Process isolation / site-local execution | Extract adapter behind the same interface into a go-plugin subprocess. |

If a profile has no fan devices configured, behavior is identical to today.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure device backend

> **Status: merged** as [#724](https://github.com/block/proto-fleet/pull/724)

>
> - **Deferred: response-profile delete guard → PR 3.**
>   `facility_fan_device_ids` does not exist until Phase 3, so the guard
>   has nothing to check yet. A `TODO(#723, PR 3)` marks the spot on

>   - NotFound masking on Get/Update/Delete so device existence does not
>     leak across site scopes.
>   - `driver_config` redacted (empty string) for `site:read`-only

This phase includes the driver `Controller` interface, registry, and the
Modbus TCP adapter's config validation (moved up from Phase 4), because the
CRUD service's `driver_config` validation delegates to them — without that,
Phase 1 is not independently executable. Phase 4 retains protocol I/O.

- **Migration** (new `server/migrations/` pair): `infrastructure_device`
  table — `id`, `site_id` (FK to site), `building_name`, `name`,
  `device_kind` (`single_fan` | `fan_group`), `fan_count`, `enabled`,
  `driver_type` (text, `modbus_tcp` for now), `driver_config` (opaque jsonb
  owned by the adapter; for Modbus TCP: `endpoint`, `port`, `unit_id`,
  `register_address`, `write_mode` coil|holding_register), timestamps. The
  core never interprets `driver_config`.
- **Proto**: new `proto/infrastructure/v1/infrastructure.proto` —
  `InfrastructureDevice` message carrying `driver_type` (string) +
  `driver_config` (JSON string or `google.protobuf.Struct`), and
  `InfrastructureService` with List/Get/Create/Update/Delete. Deliberately
  no per-protocol proto messages, so new driver types need no proto change.
  Run `just gen` and commit generated code together.
- **Driver interface + config validation** (moved up from Phase 4):
  `server/internal/domain/infrastructure/driver/` with the `Controller`
  interface and `driver_type` → factory registry; `driver/modbustcp/`
  config parsing and `ValidateConfig` limits (unit ID 1–247, port 1–65535,
  register address 0–65535, endpoint restricted to private RFC1918 / IPv6
  ULA addresses — loopback, link-local, multicast, broadcast, and public
  addresses are all rejected, since the server will open raw TCP writes to
  whatever endpoint is stored and Modbus has no authentication; a real PLC
  lives on a private OT subnet, whereas loopback targets server-local
  services and link-local includes cloud instance-metadata). A genuinely
  non-RFC1918 control endpoint would be a future explicit per-site
  allowlist decision, not a blanket allowance.
- **Server**: sqlc queries (`server/sqlc/queries/infrastructure_device.sql`);
  domain CRUD service that validates the protocol-blind fields itself and
  delegates `driver_config` validation to the driver registry; Connect
  handlers gated on `site:read` / `site:manage` (matching the existing UI
  gate in
  `client/src/protoFleet/features/fleetManagement/pages/FleetInfraPage.tsx`).
- **Delete guard** *(moved to Phase 3 — the column it checks doesn't exist
  until then)*: Delete returns FailedPrecondition while the device ID
  appears in any response profile's `facility_fan_device_ids`, telling the
  operator to update those profiles first — mirrors the existing guard that
  blocks response-profile deletion while automation rules reference it
  (`response_profile.go`).

## Phase 2: Client — add, edit, and persist devices

- New API hook `useInfrastructureDevices` (list/create/update/delete)
  following the pattern of
  `client/src/protoFleet/api/useCurtailmentResponseProfiles.ts`.
- `FleetInfraPage.tsx` fetches devices from the API instead of defaulting to
  an empty local list; `InfraDeviceList` add/toggle actions call the API
  instead of mutating local state.
- Rework `ManualAddStep` for the adapter model: keep name, site/building,
  target type, fan count; the connection section becomes a driver-type
  select (Modbus TCP, sole option for now) that renders a per-driver-type
  form module (e.g. `driverForms/modbusTcp.tsx` exporting fields, defaults,
  and validation for endpoint, port, unit ID, register address, write mode).
  New driver types register a form module + select option without touching
  the modal. Reuse the field-help popover pattern.
  - The register address field takes the raw application address (e.g.
    `2001`, or `0001` for the coil), validated 0–65535, with field-help
    copy explicitly warning against the `4xxxx`-prefixed convention and
    noting the wire-level off-by-one (the adapter owns the wire
    translation) — the doc's own hardware section shows three address
    conventions in play, and with no read-back in v1 a wrong-convention
    entry only surfaces during a live curtailment.
  - Each form module also exports a connection-summary renderer used for a
    single generic "Connection" list column and the detail modal's info
    rows, replacing today's endpoint/port/unit-ID columns — those fields
    move into the opaque `driver_config`, so the list can no longer read
    them directly.
- **Edit**: rework the existing edit surface — `InfraDeviceList`'s Edit row
  action and row click already open `InfraDeviceDetailModal` — to render the
  same per-driver-type form module and submit through the update/delete
  RPCs. The detail modal stays the canonical edit surface; no second edit
  flow is introduced.
- **States for the API-backed list** (the local-state component lacks
  these today): list-level loading and fetch-error with retry; add/edit
  modals surface RPC failures inline via the `actionError` banner pattern
  used by `CurtailmentStartModal`; the Enabled switch reverts on failure
  with an error toast instead of today's fire-and-forget optimistic toggle.
- **Status columns**: hide the Status and Last seen columns, the offline
  Alert styling, and the detail modal's status header (plus their filters)
  until v2 read-back can populate them — v1 has no status source, so every
  device would otherwise render permanently offline with error styling.

### Implementation prep notes (post-PR 1 code inventory)

- The generated TS client already exists at
  `client/src/protoFleet/api/generated/infrastructure/v1/infrastructure_pb.ts`
  (`InfrastructureService` descriptor + request/response schemas), but
  the service is not yet registered in
  `client/src/protoFleet/api/clients.ts` — add an `infrastructureClient`
  there.
- **Data-shape mapping**: the UI's `InfraDeviceItem`
  (`features/infrastructure/types.ts`) uses flat `endpoint`/`port`/
  `unitId` fields and `siteName` strings; the API uses an opaque
  `driverConfig` JSON string (`endpoint`, `port`, `unit_id`,
  `register_address`, `write_mode`) and `site_id: bigint`. Map site name
  ↔ ID via `FleetOutletContext.sites`; the per-driver form module owns
  the `driverConfig` encode/decode.
- **Redaction**: `driver_config` comes back as an empty string for
  `site:read`-only callers — the connection-summary column and detail
  rows must degrade gracefully (render an em dash or hide) rather than
  fail to parse.
- **Enabled toggle**: `UpdateInfrastructureDeviceRequest.enabled` is
  `optional bool`; the toggle should send only `enabled` and rely on the
  server's preserve-on-omit semantics for the other fields it doesn't
  intend to change.
- **Routing**: `/fleet/infrastructure` is already routed and prefetched
  (`routePrefetch.ts` exports `importFleetInfraPage`; `router.tsx` lazy
  route exists) — no route changes needed.
- **State ownership**: today `InfraDeviceList` holds `localDevices` in
  `useState` and all CRUD mutates it locally; PR 2 moves ownership into
  the new `useInfrastructureDevices` hook and passes devices + mutation
  callbacks down.
- **Tests to extend**: `InfraDeviceList.test.tsx`,
  `ManualAddStep.test.tsx`, `InfraDeviceDetailModal.test.tsx`,
  `FleetInfraPage.test.tsx`; no API-hook test exists yet (mirror
  `useCurtailmentResponseProfiles.test.tsx`).

## Phase 3: Response profile fan settings

- **Proto + schema**: add to `CurtailmentResponseProfile` and its
  create/update requests: `facility_fan_device_ids` (repeated),
  `fan_off_delay_sec` (delay after miners confirmed curtailed before fan
  OFF), `fan_restore_delay_sec` (delay after fan ON before miner restore).
  Migration adds `facility_fan_device_ids bigint[]`, `fan_off_delay_sec`,
  `fan_restore_delay_sec` to `curtailment_response_profile`. Validation in
  `ResponseProfileService.validateAndNormalize`: device IDs exist, belong to
  the org, and each device's `site_id` falls within the profile's
  site/scope — org-only validation would let a profile scoped to site B
  shut off site A's fan while site A's miners hash uncurtailed. Devices
  with `enabled = false` are accepted with a warning (see enabled
  semantics in Phase 5).
- **Device delete guard** (deferred here from Phase 1): once
  `facility_fan_device_ids` exists, `infrastructure.Service.Delete`
  returns FailedPrecondition while the device ID appears in any response
  profile's `facility_fan_device_ids`, telling the operator to update
  those profiles first — mirrors the existing guard that blocks
  response-profile deletion while automation rules reference it
  (`response_profile.go`). The landing site is marked with a
  `TODO(#723, PR 3)` on `Service.Delete` in
  `server/internal/domain/infrastructure/service.go`.
- **Fan device claim rule**: a fan device may be referenced by at most one
  non-terminal curtailment event. `Start` (and automation start) rejects
  when any of the profile's fan devices are already claimed by another
  non-terminal event — mirrors miner ownership semantics, and is mandatory
  with per-cycle re-assertion: two concurrent events re-asserting opposite
  desired states would physically toggle the fan every reconciler tick.
- **Client**: new "Facility fans" section in
  `client/src/protoFleet/features/energy/CurtailmentStartModal.tsx`
  (responseProfile variant only): device multi-select using the modal's
  established `TargetSelectButton` + checkbox-modal pattern (as Sites and
  Miners do), devices grouped by site and filtered to the profile's site
  scope, with an empty state directing operators to the Fleet Infra page
  when no devices exist; disabled devices render with a "disabled" badge.
  Two seconds fields validated with `parseOptionalUint32Field` from
  `client/src/protoFleet/features/energy/curtailmentNumericFields.ts`;
  blank means 0 seconds (matching restore-interval semantics). Extend
  `ResponseProfileFormValues` in
  `client/src/protoFleet/features/settings/components/Curtailment/types.ts`
  and `buildResponseProfilePayload`.

## Phase 4: Modbus TCP adapter protocol I/O

The `Controller` interface, registry, and config validation landed in
Phase 1; this phase implements the write path.

**Precondition (per launch site):** confirm the production server
deployment has IP routing to the site's Modbus TCP endpoints (drive or
PLC). Facility drives typically live on isolated OT segments, and the repo
already has a fleetnode architecture precisely because some deployments
can only command site-local devices through an on-site node. A site
reachable only via fleetnode makes the future-work site-local driver a
prerequisite for that site, not a follow-up — verify before building.

**Precondition (dial-time endpoint authorization):** the save-time
RFC1918/ULA guard bounds what can be persisted, but it cannot know which
private subnet is a site's commissioned OT segment — so on its own it
would let a site:manage caller aim the server's raw Modbus writer at
unrelated private infrastructure. The write path must therefore enforce a
per-site commissioned control-subnet allowlist at dial time (captured
during the Gap 1 commissioning checklist) and reject
server-infrastructure CIDRs, before any frame is sent. Writes stay
disabled for a site until its allowlist is commissioned. (Recorded as a
security precondition on `modbustcp.SetState`.)

- `driver/modbustcp/` adapter I/O: single coil write (FC5) or holding
  register write (FC6) of 0/1 per `write_mode`, with a short connect
  timeout and a single attempt per call — cross-cycle re-assertion
  (Phase 5) owns repetition, so the adapter does not retry internally.
  Add a Go Modbus client dependency (verify current library options at
  implementation time — e.g. `grid-x/modbus`; do not pin from memory),
  then `go work sync`.
- Simulator: a `sim` adapter registered only in dev/test builds (log-only)
  plus a small Modbus TCP listener under `server/devtools/` so `just dev`
  and tests don't need real hardware.

## Phase 5: Reconciler sequencing

- **Event stamping**: at `Start` (and in
  `startRequestFromAutomationProfile` in
  `server/internal/domain/curtailment/automation.go`), copy the profile's
  fan device IDs and delays onto `curtailment_event` (migration:
  `facility_fan_device_ids`, `fan_off_delay_sec`, `fan_restore_delay_sec`,
  `fan_off_sent_at`, `fan_on_sent_at`, `fan_last_error`).
- **Curtail path**: in the reconciler's active phase (`observeActive`), when
  the event has fan devices and `fan_off_sent_at` is null, the fan-OFF gate
  requires all of:
  1. `started_at + fan_off_delay_sec` elapsed — reuse the existing
     `started_at` column (`maybeMarkActive` stamps it on every
     pending→active transition, including recurtail re-activation via
     `UpdateCurtailmentEventState`); no new `activated_at` column.
  2. The miner target rollup confirms curtailment: no curtail-desired
     targets outside confirmed/terminal states. ACTIVE alone is not
     sufficient — closed-loop full-fleet events flip to ACTIVE with zero
     targets and keep admitting/dispatching miners while ACTIVE, so a
     state-only gate could shut the fan off while miners still hash.
     Newly admitted closed-loop targets after fan OFF are acceptable (they
     curtail promptly and the delay already elapsed once); the gate
     protects the initial transition.
  When the gate passes, resolve each device's adapter through the registry
  and call `Controller.SetState(off)`, stamping `fan_off_sent_at`. Each
  reconciler cycle makes one attempt per device (no in-tick backoff — the
  30s tick is the retry cadence); failures record `fan_last_error` and
  alert (activity log) on the transition into failure, without failing the
  event.
- **State re-assertion**: `fan_off_sent_at` / `fan_on_sent_at` gate only
  the first write (for delay handling and miner-restore gating). While a
  fan phase is active, the reconciler re-asserts the desired fan state on
  every cycle so a drive/PLC restart mid-phase is corrected and the
  fieldbus link never goes quiet (see "Hardware review findings and gaps",
  Gap 2). Re-assertion failures update `fan_last_error` but alert only on
  transition from succeeding to failing, not every cycle.
- **Retry/attempt layering**: the adapter owns a single protocol attempt
  with a connect timeout per `SetState` call; the reconciler owns
  repetition across cycles (first-write attempts and re-assertion). Fan
  I/O runs inside the reconciler's shared tick budget (2× tick interval
  for all events combined), so per-device I/O must be strictly bounded —
  short connect timeout, one attempt per device per cycle — or one
  unreachable PLC would starve miner dispatch for every other event.
- **Enabled semantics**: device resolution at command-send time skips
  devices with `enabled = false`, logging the skip (activity log) rather
  than erroring; a device missing at write time (deleted mid-event) is
  handled the same way. Profile validation warns on, but does not reject,
  disabled device references.
- **Restore path**: on entering `restoring` (`BeginRestoreTransition` or
  reconciler pickup), send fan ON first and stamp `fan_on_sent_at`; gate
  `maybeClaimRestoreBatch` so no miner restore batch is claimed until
  `fan_on_sent_at + fan_restore_delay_sec`. Per the delay-only decision,
  persistent send failure (bounded number of cycles) stamps
  `fan_on_sent_at` anyway with `fan_last_error` recorded, so miners still
  restore — this raises the operator-visible alert from Decision 2, and
  re-assertion keeps attempting fan ON on subsequent cycles. The fan-ON
  send must run before `maybeCompleteRestoring`'s completion check so an
  all-targets-terminal event cannot complete without it. Recurtail resets
  the fan phase fields.
- **Terminal paths that bypass restore**: `AdminTerminate` and
  `ForceRelease` make events terminal without entering (or completing)
  `restoring`, and the reconciler only processes non-terminal events — as
  written, they would strand the fan physically OFF with no code path ever
  turning it back on while miners get restored manually. When either path
  terminalizes an event whose `fan_off_sent_at` is set and `fan_on_sent_at`
  is null, send a best-effort fan ON and stamp `fan_on_sent_at` before the
  event goes terminal, recording `fan_last_error` and an activity-log alert
  on failure. Force-release messaging must state that physical fan state is
  not guaranteed.
- Expose the fan timestamps/error on `CurtailmentEvent` proto so the Energy
  panel can later show fan phase (rendering is optional follow-up, not in
  scope).

## Delivery: PR grouping

Five stacked PRs, one per phase, each independently reviewable and safe to
merge in order — no fan behavior activates until PR 5 lands, so PRs 1–4
are pure surface area with no operational risk:

| PR | Scope | Contents | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PR 1 (**merged** — [#724](https://github.com/block/proto-fleet/pull/724), tracker [#723](https://github.com/block/proto-fleet/issues/723)) | Infra device backend (Phase 1) | Migration (landed as `000122` after renumbering past a collision with main), `proto/infrastructure/v1` + generated code, driver `Controller` interface + registry + modbustcp `ValidateConfig`, sqlc queries, CRUD service, Connect handlers. Delete guard deferred to PR 3 (see Phase 1 status note). | — |
| PR 2 (tracker [#742](https://github.com/block/proto-fleet/issues/742)) | Infra device client (Phase 2) | `useInfrastructureDevices` hook, API-backed `InfraDeviceList` with loading/error states, add-modal rework with per-driver form module, detail-modal edit rework, status-column hiding | PR 1 |
| PR 3 | Profile fan settings (Phase 3) | Profile proto + migration + site-scope/org validation, "Facility fans" section in the profile modal (picker, delay fields) | PR 1 (PR 2 for the picker's device list) |
| PR 4 | Modbus write path (Phase 4) | modbustcp protocol I/O, Go Modbus dependency + `go work sync`, `sim` adapter, devtools Modbus TCP listener | PR 1 |
| PR 5 | Reconciler sequencing (Phase 5) | Event stamping, fan device claim rule at Start, fan-OFF gate, re-assertion, restore path, terminal-path fan ON, `CurtailmentEvent` proto exposure | PRs 3, 4 |

Each PR carries its own tests from the Testing section. The site
commissioning checklist (Hardware review, Gap 1) and the Phase 4 network
reachability precondition gate *enabling* fan devices at a site, not any
PR merge.

## Testing

- Server: domain tests for device CRUD/validation (including the delete
  guard and endpoint restrictions) and profile validation (site-scope and
  claim rules) against real Postgres (docker-compose, per repo rule);
  reconciler tests for both delay gates, the miner-rollup fan-OFF gate,
  no-fan passthrough, send-failure alerting, recurtail reset, terminal-path
  fan ON (`AdminTerminate`/`ForceRelease`), and per-cycle state
  re-assertion (including recovery after a simulated device restart);
  modbustcp driver unit test against the devtools Modbus TCP listener.
- Client: unit tests for the reworked add/edit modal and the new profile
  section (extend `useCurtailmentResponseProfiles.test.tsx` and
  `ManualAddStep.test.tsx`).
- Repo hygiene: `just gen` after proto/sqlc/migration changes,
  `go work sync` after the Modbus dependency, feature branch, `just lint`
  before PR.

## Future work

1. **Fan status read-back (v2).** Confirm the fan is running before miner
   restore using the H-Max status word (address `2101`: ready, run, fault,
   zero-speed) and/or actual speed (address `2103`), and block restore when
   airflow cannot be verified, with an explicit operator override policy.
   The `Controller` interface reserves `ReadStatus` for this.
2. **Fan speed control.** `curtail_action: stop | set_speed` with a speed
   percent, using the H-Max speed reference register; additive
   `DesiredState.SpeedPercent` plus adapter capability flag.
3. **Site-local / subprocess drivers.** Extract adapters into go-plugin
   subprocesses (mirroring miner drivers) when a protocol needs OT-network
   locality (e.g. Modbus RTU over RS-485 via fleetnode) or process
   isolation.
4. **Energy page fan phase UI.** Render the fan timestamps/error exposed on
   `CurtailmentEvent` as an operator-visible fan phase with delay
   countdowns.

## Non-goals (v1)

1. No fan status reads or restore blocking — sequencing is delay-only.
2. No speed control — on/off (0/1) writes only.
3. No go-plugin subprocess machinery for infrastructure drivers.
4. No broad building automation control beyond the fans required for
   curtailment.

## Deferred / Open Questions

### From 2026-07-09 review

- **Manual profile-prefilled starts cannot carry fan settings as specified** — Phase 5: Reconciler sequencing (P2, feasibility, confidence 75)

  The plan says to copy the profile's fan device IDs and delays onto the
  event "at Start", but the domain `StartRequest` has no response-profile
  linkage — profiles reach `Start` only via
  `startRequestFromAutomationProfile`. Manual starts from the Energy page
  prefill form values from a profile client-side and submit a plain
  `StartCurtailment` request, so fan fields would be silently dropped for
  manually started events from the same profile unless
  `StartCurtailmentRequest`, `StartRequest`, and the client request
  builders also gain the fields. Decide: extend the manual-start path in
  v1, or document fan sequencing as automation-only.
