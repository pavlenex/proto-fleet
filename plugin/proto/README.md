# Proto Miner Plugin

A Fleet plugin for the Proto mining system, implementing SDK v1 with credentials-based authentication and testing.

## Overview

This plugin provides Proto miner integration for the Fleet mining system. It demonstrates:

- Architecture with separation of concerns
- Patterns for error handling, logging, and testing
- Authentication with Ed25519 key pairs and JWT token management
- Testing with unit tests, integration tests, and containerized testing
- Compatibility with Proto sim-miners and production devices

## Quick Start

Build and run the plugin:

```bash
go build -o proto-plugin
./proto-plugin
```

## Usage Patterns

### For Learning

1. **Read the getting started guide**: `docs/getting-started.md`
2. **Study SDK patterns**: `docs/sdk-patterns.md`
3. **Explore the implementation**: `internal/` and `pkg/`

### For Development

1. **Copy the structure**: Use as a template for new plugins
2. **Adapt the client**: Modify `pkg/proto/client.go` for your miner API
3. **Update discovery**: Change `internal/driver/driver.go` for your protocol
4. **Customize device logic**: Modify `internal/device/device.go` for your features

### For Production

1. **Build the plugin**: `go build -o proto-plugin`
2. **Configure environment**: Set `SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`, `LOG_LEVEL`, etc.
3. **Deploy with Fleet**: Reference the binary in Fleet configuration
4. **Monitor logs**: Check for authentication and connectivity issues

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true` - Skip TLS certificate verification
- `INSECURE_TLS=true` - Allow insecure TLS connections
- `LOG_LEVEL=debug` - Set logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `PLUGIN_TIMEOUT=30s` - Set operation timeout
- `PLUGIN_MAX_RETRIES=3` - Set retry attempts

### Device Discovery

The plugin discovers Proto miners on its configured port, which defaults to `443` and can be overridden with `PROTO_MINER_PORT`. Discovery tries HTTPS first, then HTTP:

```go
// Automatic discovery on the configured Proto port
deviceInfo, err := driver.DiscoverDevice(ctx, "192.168.1.100", "443")
```

### Authentication

The plugin authenticates to Proto rigs with username/password credentials. The
factory defaults are `admin` / `proto`; the server auto-pairs with these when the
operator does not supply credentials (see `GetDefaultCredentials`). The client
logs in to the rig's `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint, caches the returned access
token, and re-logs in automatically when the rig rejects the token.

#### Credentials Authentication (Pairing and Operations)
```go
// Pair and operate with username/password credentials.
secret := sdk.SecretBundle{
    Version: "v1",
    Kind: sdk.UsernamePassword{
        Username: "admin",
        Password: "proto",
    },
}
```

Proto devices without stored credentials are treated as needing authentication
and are repaired by the normal failed-poll remediation flow. Fleet keeps
factory-password rigs command-eligible; Proto firmware or the driver may reject
specific operations until `UpdateMinerPassword` clears the default password.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests for core functionality and authentication:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
go test ./tests/unit -v

# Run specific authentication tests
go test ./tests/unit -run TestSecretBundleExtraction -v
go test ./tests/unit -run TestClientAuthInterceptor -v

# Run JWT utility tests
go test ./tests/testutils -v
```

### Integration Tests

The plugin includes comprehensive integration tests using testcontainers:

```bash
# Run full integration tests with containerized sim-miner
go test ./tests -run TestProtoPluginIntegration -v

# Run additional integration test coverage
go test ./tests -run TestProtoPluginWithRealSimMiner -v

# Run all integration tests
go test ./tests -v

# Skip integration tests (run only unit tests)
go test -short ./...
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only
go test ./tests/unit/...

# All tests including integration
go test ./...

# With coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./tests/unit/

# Specific test patterns
go test ./tests -run TestProtoPluginIntegration -v
```

### Building

```bash
# Development build
go build -o proto-plugin

# Production build with optimizations
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o proto-plugin

# Cross-compilation
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o proto-plugin-linux
```

### Using Justfile (Optional)

The project includes a `justfile` for common development tasks:

```bash
# Install just if not already installed
# brew install just  # macOS
# cargo install just  # Rust/Cargo

# View available commands
just --list

# Example usage (if justfile commands are defined)
just test
just build
just lint
```

### Adding Features

1. **Update capabilities** in `internal/driver/driver.go`
2. **Implement methods** in `internal/device/device.go`
3. **Add API calls** in `pkg/proto/client.go`
4. **Write tests** in `tests/unit/` and update integration tests
5. **Update authentication** if needed in client auth interceptors
6. **Update documentation** including this README

## Contributing

This plugin serves as a reference implementation for the community. When making changes:

1. Maintain clarity: Keep code readable and well-documented
2. Add tests: Cover new functionality with both unit and integration tests
3. Document patterns: Update docs for new authentication or API patterns
4. Consider beginners: Think about the learning experience for new developers
5. Test thoroughly: Verify changes work with both containerized and real miners
6. Security first: Ensure authentication and cryptographic implementations follow best practices

## Security Considerations

When working with this plugin:

- Ed25519 keys: Private keys should never be logged or exposed
- JWT tokens: Tokens should have appropriate expiration times
- TLS verification: Only disable for development/testing environments
- Credential storage: Use secure methods for storing authentication materials
- Network security: Prefer HTTPS over HTTP in production deployments
